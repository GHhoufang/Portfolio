# Portfolio
Activity_ Course 7 Salifort Motors project lab_hf.ipynb
is the final case in Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate course. My goals in this project are to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.

LendingClubDefaultPredication.ipynb
is a case to predict if an applicant for an online loan will default or not based on LendingClub's history dataset. The original dataset contains 1.648M entries and 150 columns. Since it came from the real world, data preprocessing took a lot of work.

CreditScore.ipynb
is a case of using WOE and IV for attribute analysis to select attributes to be included in the Logistic model for fitting the dataset of normal/default users in the existing dataset, scaling the linear equation, and finally obtaining the credit scoring result.
